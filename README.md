## Data Integration Approach

### Syllabus Analysis Method
1. **Primary Source Extraction:** All data derived from official course syllabi provided by the student
2. **Cross-Reference Verification:** Reading schedules cross-checked against assignment due dates
3. **Workload Distribution Analysis:** 445 OT chapters strategically distributed across 14 weeks
4. **Advance Planning Strategy:** All readings scheduled 7-10 days before class discussions
5. **Assignment Preparation:** Major assignments broken into manageable preparation phases

### Reading Schedule Integration
- **Textbook Coordination:** Multiple textbooks per course distributed to avoid overwhelming weeks
- **Biblical Reading Management:** 445 OT chapters divided into logical thematic groups
- **Skills Development Progression:** Counseling skills chapters aligned with practical application deadlines
- **Research Timeline:** 12-15 page research paper broken into topic selection, research, writing, and editing phases

1. **Missing Kessler Integration:** Original oversight corrected to include both required OLDT textbooks
2. **Accurate Start Date:** Adjusted from September 1 to September 9 (current date)
3. **Complete Book Titles:** Full bibliographic information included rather than author names only
4. **Syllabus Compliance:** Weekly reading assignments verified against official course schedules

## HTML Structure and Design Philosophy

### Color Coding System
- **Greyscale Base:** All regular study days use neutral colors for readability
- **Blue Highlighting:** Class days only (maintains focus on academic commitments)
- **Red Highlighting:** Holidays and breaks
- **Orange Highlighting:** Assignment due dates and deadlines
- **Simplified Palette:** Reduced visual noise while maintaining functional color coding

### Data Organization Hierarchy
